# Android

This is an android project which I have seen from udacity called Sushine.
This is a simple weather app which runs taking the input of any place postal code.In this I have connected my app with openweathermap which gives the update of weather according to the postal code  what we have enter in this I have used the longitude and latitude value to connect it with google maps as well.In this I have also used json to parse data from server and created an android database using sqlite database.
